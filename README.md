### Hi there 👋

I’m a Software Developer passionate about building scalable and user-focused applications. My core strengths are in **Android (Kotlin, Java)** and **Flutter**, but I also work with **web technologies** to build full-stack solutions when needed.

I care about clean architecture, reusable components, and solving real-world problems through thoughtful design and efficient code.

- 🔧 Tools I use: Android Studio, VS Code, Xcode, Git, Swagger
- 🌐 Interests: Web, Mobile apps, APIs, payments, microservices
- 🚀 Always learning and open to collaboration
