My name is Femi Adegbite. I'm an Mobile Engineer at [Riby](https://riby.me), revampingÂ [Enumerator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ng.riby.enumerator.trade&hl=en)Â - letting you easily collect dynamics data for several company, reasons, products etc in places without internet.

I love developing for Android, and also enjoy building stuff with flutter.
